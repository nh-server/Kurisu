The 3DS *can* use SD cards up to 2TB in size. However, using cards larger than 128GB is not recommended, as it tends to cause issues. Any cards over 32GB will have to be formatted to FAT32 in a computer or hacked console before they can be used (use an allocation unit size of 32KB/32768 for 64GB cards and 64KB/65536 for 128GB cards or larger).

Buy SD cards from reputable brands (SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston, etc.). Preferably, purchase cards from a brick and mortar store near you, but Amazon is okay if you must purchase online. __**NEVER**__ buy cards from AliExpress, Wish, eBay or other similar sites.

Speed is irrelevant for the 3DS - it is limited to Class 4 (4MB/s) speeds. The only reason to buy a faster SD card is for faster data transfer to your computer.
