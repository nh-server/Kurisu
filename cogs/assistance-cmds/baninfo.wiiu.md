help-desc: Explains bans on the Wii U

# Nintendo cares little to almost none about the Wii U anymore. 
As long as you don't mod or cheat in online games, they don't have a reason to ban you.
They cannot physically see if you have homebrew on your console either. Even if they did, they still wouldn't care.
