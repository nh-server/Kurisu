title: Missing Wii Homebrew Apps
help-desc: What to do when some or all apps are missing from Homebrew.
---



If some or all homebrew apps are missing from the Homebrew Channel, chances are they're not in the right place. Make sure the homebrew apps are actually in `SD:/apps`.
If you have either an `apps (1)`, recurring `apps`, `Apps`, or anything similar, transfer the contents of them to the `apps` folder on the root.
