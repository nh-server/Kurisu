The Nintendo Switch can use SD cards up to 2TB in size when formatted to FAT32.

The recommended size is 128GB, however you may want more (256, 512..) if you want to use an emuMMC, run Android or run Linux.

The recommended filesystem format is FAT32. While the Switch supports exFAT through an additional update from Nintendo, the filesystem driver used by Nintendo is prone to corruption and as a result is not advisable.

Buy SD cards from reputable brands (SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston, etc.). Preferably, purchase cards from a brick and mortar store near you, but Amazon is okay if you must purchase online. __**NEVER**__ buy cards from AliExpress, Wish, eBay or other similar sites.

The Nintendo Switch can read SD cards up to 90MB/s, so we recommend using a UHS-I rated card to get the most speed out of your Nintendo Switch.

If you intend to run Android or Linux on your Nintendo Switch, ensure you do **not** get one with (DDR200)[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#UHS-I>] incompatibility, as they may not work on Android or Linux at all.
