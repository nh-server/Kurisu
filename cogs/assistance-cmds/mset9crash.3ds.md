Is your Extra Data stuck at infinitely loading while trying to install Boot9strap with MSET9?

If you are at Section II Step 5: 

You injected early. Force power off your 3DS, put the SD in your PC, run the script, choose your model and version then choose option 4 to remove the trigger file. Repeat Section II carefully.

If you are at Section II Step 12 with MSET9-CLI:

Be sure you are choosing the [proper console model](https://3ds.hacks.guide/images/3dsmodels.png) and system firmware version. If you are sure it is correct, back up your SD card to a folder on your PC, [format](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card) your SD card, copy everything back to your SD and try again.
