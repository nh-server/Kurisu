Extra Data stuck at infinitely loading while trying to install Boot9strap with MSET9?

If you are at Section II Step 5: 

You injected early. Force power off your 3DS, put the SD in your PC/tablet/phone, run the script and choose option 3 to remove MSET9. Repeat Section II carefully.

If you are at Section II Step 12:

Be sure you are choosing the proper console model AND system firmware version. If you are sure it is correct, please perform a [fresh install](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/3DS:MSET9_fresh).
