help-desc: Some troubleshooting steps to connect your Wii to the Internet

The Wii needs a 2.4ghz signal with network 802.11b/g/n enabled, and the security type set to at best WPA2-PSK (AES). The channel must also either be set to auto or be less than 12. 

Known routers incompatible with these settings:
- Xfinity
- Spectrum

If your ISP will not let you change these settings, you have a few options:
- You can try a hotspot. This is not recommended as it usually results in an unstable connection.
- You can use a LAN adapter. It must have the ASIX AX88772 Chipset or say “compatible with Wii”. Here’s a recommended LAN adapter by uGreen: https://a.co/d/3OcSJDS
- Alternatively, you can buy a router and just use the isp you already have, like a mesh network. Here’s a cheap router that should work for the Wii: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Netis-WF2412-Wireless-router-4-port-switch-802-11b-g-n-2-4-GHz/37406393
