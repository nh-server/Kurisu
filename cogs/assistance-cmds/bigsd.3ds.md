Although Nintendo says the official SD size limit is 32GB, the 3DS can accept cards up to 2TB. Ideally though, 128GB is the safe limit, as you will experience graphical issues while running GBA and NDS games, themes, and much slower load times if you use a larger SD card.
In order to use cards larger than 32GB, you will have to format them to FAT32 first. Follow the intructions here to format it:
