Is your 3DS having strange issues or just not able to boot properly? Consider running a Hardware Test to verify your RAM is fine.
- Run [Hardware Test](<https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/3DS:Hardware_test>) using this guide. 
Please note: if the console is unmodded, your only option is to run the test using [ntrboot](<https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot>)
Once this test has completed, any amount of errors above 0 indicates RAM failure. This is currently unfixable barring a complete motherboard replacement. If you need assistance transferring your files to a new console/motherboard, you can ask in  https://discord.com/channels/196618637950451712/196635695958196224 .

*While it's technically possible to replace the RAM, it's very time consuming, requires a donor board, and would likely end up costing more than a replacement board, or a whole new console.*
*If your console is an Old 2DS or New 2DS XL, it may be worth looking into a repair from [Nintendo](<https://www.nintendo.com/>)*
