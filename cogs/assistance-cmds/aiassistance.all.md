- LLMs (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Google AI, etc) don't
actually understand the information they are working
with, and are frequently wrong.
- The information these LLMs pull from the internet
is often critically wrong or unorganized, which
can lead to problems up to and including bricks.
- LLMs also have frequent problems with making
things up so that they always have an answer for
everything. Made up advice is bad advice.
