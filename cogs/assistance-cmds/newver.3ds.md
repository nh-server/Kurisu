title: Is the new 3DS update safe?
help-desc: Quick advice for new versions

Currently, the latest 3DS system firmware is `11.17.0-50`.

If you currently have CFW installed (boot9strap/Luma):
Is your Luma version up to date? If your Luma version is 10.2.1 or above, **updating is safe**.
If it is 10.2 or below, please type `.update` in <#261581918653513729> and follow the information there.

If you DO NOT currently have CFW installed (stock console):
11.17.0-50 CANNOT be hacked with current methods. **Do NOT update your console**; check 3DS Hacks Guide for a suitable path for your current system version.
