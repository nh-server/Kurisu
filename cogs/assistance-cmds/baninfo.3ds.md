As of April 8th 2024, Nintendo Network has been shut down, meaning bans are no longer possible. Using a hacked console is safe.

You can enable online status and SpotPass/StreetPass as these pose no risk at all.

Nintendo Network replacements do exist, however they have their own set of rules to follow.
