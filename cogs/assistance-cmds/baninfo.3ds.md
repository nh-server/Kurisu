**Nintendo has shown a marked lack of care about bans on the 3DS lately.**
However, such things as piracy and cheating online/cheating in multiplayer games have been known causes for NNID/console bans in the past.
eShop fraud (e.g. credit card chargebacks) will also get you banned.

You can enable online status and Spotpass/Streetpass as these do not seem to be high risk at this time.
