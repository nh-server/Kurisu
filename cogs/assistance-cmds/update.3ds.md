**Before updating, check your Luma3DS version by holding Select on bootup and looking at the top screen.**

**Luma3DS 10.2.1 and above**
You can update safely.

**Luma3DS 8.0 - 10.2**
Please follow the directions on the [Restoring / Updating CFW](https://3ds.hacks.guide/restoring-updating-cfw.html) page, then you can update. Being on these Luma3DS versions on 11.8+ will cause an error screen until you update.

Follow the [B9S upgrade guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/updating-b9s.html)

**Luma3DS 7.0.5 and below**
