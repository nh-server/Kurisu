title: Missing Wii U Homebrew Apps
help-desc: What to do when some or all apps are missing from Homebrew.

If the Homebrew Launcher (Tiramisu) or Wii U Menu (Aroma) doesn't have some or all of your homebrew apps present, either they were never installed or they're in the wrong place.
Make sure there are Homebrew apps in `SD:/wiiu/apps`. (If you only have `homebrew_launcher` (folder) and/or `PayloadLoaderInstaller.wuhb` in said location, this also counts as having no apps in the Homebrew Launcher.)
If you have either an `apps (1)`, recurring `apps`, or `Apps` folder, move the contents of them to the `apps` folder in /wiiu/.

Remember that Aroma does not support .elf files and some .rpx files!
