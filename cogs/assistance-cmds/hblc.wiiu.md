title: Entering Homebrew Launcher
help-desc: What to and not to do to open the HBL
---

After installing Tiramisu, you can simply open the Mii Maker to enter the Homebrew Launcher.

Using the standalone *Homebrew Launcher Channel* is not recommended and might cause crashes and freezes.
If you still want to install the HBLC, download the following file and copy it to the `install` folder on the root of your SD Card: <https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/homebrew_launcher/releases/tag/v2.1_fix>
After installing the Channel using WUP Installer GX2, remove the `sd:\wiiu\environments\tiramisu\modules\setup\50_hbl_installer.rpx` file from your SD Card.

*Note:* This will also remove the HBL injection from the Mii Maker.
