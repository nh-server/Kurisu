title: Looking to hack your Switch?
help-desc: Advisory for various Nintendo systems on stock firmware
---

Use [our guide](https://switch.hacks.guide/user_guide/getting_started/) to determine if your Switch is a first-gen unit.
**First generation consoles (RCM exploitable)**
All of these can run [Atmosphere](https://switch.hacks.guide/). Make sure that Atmosphere is compatible with the latest firmware version before you update.

**Second generation consoles ("patched" units, Switch Lite, Mariko, etc.)**

**"Old" Patched Switch (HAC-001)**: Do NOT update past 7.0.1. Units on 7.0.1 and below will eventually get CFW. Units on 8.0.0 and higher are not expected to be hacked and can be updated.
**"New" Switch (HAC-001-01)**: Do NOT update past 8.0.1. Units on 8.0.1 and below will likely get homebrew. Units on 8.1.0 and higher are not expected to be hacked and can be updated.
**Switch Lite (HDH-001)**: Do NOT update past 8.0.1. Units on 8.0.1 and below will likely get homebrew. Units on 8.1.0 and higher are not expected to be hacked and can be updated.

Downgrading is **impossible** on patched consoles, and isn't worth your time on unpatched ones.
