Step 1: Open System Settings

Step 2: Go to the System tab

Step 3: Scroll down and press on Serial information

Your serial will now be displayed on the screen.

The serial can also be found near the bottom of the switch as shown in the embeded image.

Use your serial alongside the `.ssnc` command in <#261581918653513729> to check if you switch is patched or not.
