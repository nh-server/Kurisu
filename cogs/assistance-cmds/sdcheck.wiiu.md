There are two ways to check if your SD card is being read:

- Taking a picture in Mii Maker and saving it to the SD card, which can be done like [this](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1722/~/how-to-save-a-mii-as-a-photo)

- Booting into vWii. If the SD card icon is blue, it is being detected. If it is gray, it is not detected.
