If you have Luma3DS and your console is stuck on a black screen after you power it on, follow these steps:
1. Power off the console.
2. Take out any game cartridge, but leave the SD card in.
3. Power on the console.
4. Wait 10-15 seconds, then press <:3ds_button_l:295004499511214080>+<:3ds_dpad_down:295004561670930432>+SELECT. If the Rosalina menu opens, you're likely experiencing RTCBug, and should continue with the steps below.
5. Press <:3ds_button_b:295004466963283968> to close the Rosalina menu, and then leave the console open and powered on for 10-15 minutes. Do not touch the console during this time.
If the console boots successfully in that time, the bug is now fixed and is unlikely to happen again. If the console still fails to boot to home menu, come back and ask for more help. Mention that you have already tried the RTCBug process.
