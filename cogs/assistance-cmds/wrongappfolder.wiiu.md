help-desc: Instructions on what to do if the apps go to the wrong place
---

Some (or all) of your apps are in the wrong `apps` folder.
Wii U apps (loaded from the Homebrew Launcher) go into `SD:/wiiu/apps`.
Wii apps (loaded from the Homebrew Channel) go into `SD:/apps`.
(`SD:` refers to the **root** of the SD card. **root** = not inside any folder.)
