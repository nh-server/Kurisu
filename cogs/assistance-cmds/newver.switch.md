title: Is the new Switch update safe?
help-desc: Quick advice for new versions
---

Currently, the latest Switch system firmware is `{nx_firmware}`.

If your Switch is **unpatched**:
Atmosphere and Hekate currently support {nx_firmware}, and unpatched units will always be hackable.
You should follow the precautions in our update guide if already hacked, and always update Atmosphere and Hekate before updating the system firmware.

If your Switch is **hardware patched**:
Any unit that is Mariko or above (aka 'redbox' Switches, Switch Lites, Switch OLED, etc.) is *unlikely to ever be hackable*.
