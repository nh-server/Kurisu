---

If you forgot to remove MSET9 or the script crashed with an error, you may need to remove MSET9 by hand. Follow these steps:

1. With the SD in your PC, go into your Nintendo 3DS Folder
2. You should see a 32 character folder, this is your ID0, enter this folder
3. Inside your ID0 you should see a 32 character folder that may or may not have _user-id1 appended to it, and a folder with chinese or gibberish characters
4. Delete the chinese character folder. It may throw an error, refresh the folder and it should be gone. If it refuses to delete let us know
5. Rename the other 32 character folder by removing the _user-id1 from the end of it
6. MSET9 is now removed, consider this a completion of Section IV
