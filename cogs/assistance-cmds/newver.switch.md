title: Is the new Switch update safe?
help-desc: Quick advice for new versions
---

Currently, the latest Switch system firmware is `{nx_firmware}`.

If your Switch is **unpatched**:
Atmosphere and Hekate DO NOT currently support {nx_firmware}, BUT unpatched units will always be hackable when the main tools get new releases.
Wait for further advice and information from us via <#225556031428755456>, where new releases will be posted.

If your Switch is **hardware patched**:
Any unit that is Mariko or above (aka 'redbox' Switches, Switch Lites, Switch OLED, etc.) is *unlikely to ever be hackable*.
