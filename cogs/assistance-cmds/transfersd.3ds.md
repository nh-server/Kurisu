Moving SD cards on a 3DS is easy.
First, ensure the new SD card is in the FAT32 format.
If it is above 32GB, you will need to format it using one of these tools:

-GUIFormat for Windows: http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm
-gparted for Linux: https://gparted.org/download.php
-Disk Utility for macOS: https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/format-a-disk-for-windows-computers-dskutl1010

Once the new card is in FAT32, move all your content from the old SD to the new SD.
IMPORTANT: On macOS, always select "MS-DOS (Fat)". Formatting will erase all data on the card. Make a backup first.
IMPORTANT: Do not put the new SD card in the console before moving all your data to it.
