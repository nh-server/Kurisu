Are you using the proper bit? Most Nintendo consoles use JIS screws, NOT Philips (PH) screws. While the sizes are interchangeable, using a PH bit for a JIS screw may strip it, causing irreversible damage. [Read more here.](https://hardware.hacks.guide/wiki/Identifying_screw_head_and_type) If you ever feel like you're scraping metal away, STOP. Sometimes, using a bit one size larger than the screw will allow the screw to turn.

Is it too late, and have you stripped one or multiple screws? [Learn how to remove stripped screws here.](https://hardware.hacks.guide/wiki/Guides/General_Screw_Guide)

If your screws are stripped, and you're looking to replace them, be sure to buy a set of high-quality screws. Most sets of replacement screws (i.e., eXtremeRate screws) are soft and will strip easily.
