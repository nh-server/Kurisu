If Homebrew Launcher is not showing any apps and only has a blue background and floating bubbles, you do not have any apps on the SD Card or you misplaced them.
Make sure there are Homebrew apps in `SD:/wiiu/apps`. (If you only have `homebrew_launcher` (folder) and/or `PayloadLoaderInstaller.wuhb` in said location, this also counts as having no apps.)
