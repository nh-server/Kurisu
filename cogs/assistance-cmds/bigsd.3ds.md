Although Nintendo says the official SD size limit is 32GB, the 3DS can accept cards up to 2TB. However, 128GB is the safe limit, since using a larger SD card will lead to you experiencing far slower load times, graphical issues while running GBA and NDS games, and problems with themes.
In order to use cards larger than 32GB, you will have to format them to FAT32 first. Follow the intructions here to format it:
