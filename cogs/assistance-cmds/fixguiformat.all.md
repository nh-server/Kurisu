If you struggle to format your SD card / USB device to FAT32 using GUIFormat, close any applications that might be accessing the SD card right now (such as File Explorer).

If this doesn't help, move GUIFormat to your desktop, and restart your PC. After you are back on the desktop, before doing anything else, format the SD card with GUIFormat. Run GUIFormat from the desktop to do so (avoid opening the File Explorer).
