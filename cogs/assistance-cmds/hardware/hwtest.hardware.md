Is your 3DS having strange issues or just not able to boot properly? Consider running an Hardware Test to verify you RAM is fine.
- Run [Hardware Test](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/3DS:Hardware_test) using this guide. 
Please note if you are unmodded your only option is to run using [ntrboot](https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot)
Once this test have completed, if you have `0 errors` you are good, otherwise you will need to replace the RAM.
If you have more than `0 errors` you really only have one option, and that is to backup what you can and replace the motherboard. 
If you need help with transfering to your new system/board ask in, https://discord.com/channels/196618637950451712/196635695958196224

*While its technically possible to replace the RAM, its very time consuming, requires a donor board, and would likely end up costing more than a replacment board, or a while replacment 3DS.*
*If this is an N2DSXL, it may be worth looking into a repair from [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/)*
