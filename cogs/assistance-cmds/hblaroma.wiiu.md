title: Homebrew launcher on Aroma
help-desc: Explains why HBL doesn't work on Aroma
---

The homebrew launcher does not work on Aroma, and it doesn't work because there *is* no homebrew launcher for it. Aroma is designed to launch homebrew apps on the homescreen thanks to the homebrew_on_menu plugin, which makes the Wii U menu itself a dedicated homebrew launcher.

And no, there will likely never be a standalone launcher. If you want homebrew launcher support, switch to Tiramisu, and launch Mii Maker.
