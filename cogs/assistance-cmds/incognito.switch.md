title: Why not Incognito?
help-desc: Describes why Incognito is bad and should not be used

Incognito isn't an effective method for ban prevention. 

- The console still connects to Nintendo, but they choose to ignore it completely, due to invalid console security data. **Note that this could change at any time.**
- It destructively erases unique data that cannot be regenerated in case its backup is lost. This means that you risk permanently self-banning your console inadvertently.
- Traces of Incognito remain on the system even *after* it is disabled, which works against the point of Incognito safeguarding you in the first place.

90DNS / dns.mitm are both more effective methods at ban prevention since they completely prevent the Switch from connecting to Nintendo. Instructions for their use can be found here: https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/extras/blocking_nintendo/
