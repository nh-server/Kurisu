"""
This file contains all currently known 2DS/3DS support codes.
There may be inaccuracies here; we'll do our best to correct them
when we find out more about them.

A "support" code, in contrast to a result code, is a human-readable string like
002-0102. They're meant to be more user-friendly than result codes, which are
typically integer values.

Note: the "modules" presented here are more like "categories". However, this difference
isn't enough to justify creating a different class with the same logic, so we'll just
refer to them as "modules" from now on.

To add a module/category so the code understands it, simply add a new module number
to the 'modules' dictionary, with a Module variable as the value. If the module
has no known error codes, simply add a dummy Module instead (see the dict for
more info). See the various module variables for a more in-depth example
 on how to make one.

Once you've added a module, or you want to add a new support code to an existing
module, add a new description value (for 3DS it's the 4 digit number after the dash)
as the key, and a ResultInfo variable with a text description of the error or result.
You can also add a second string to the ResultInfo to designate a support URL if
one exists. Not all support codes have known error pages.

Simple example of adding a module with a sample support code:
test = Module('test', {
    5: ResultInfo('test', 'https://example.com')
})

modules = {
    9999: test
}
