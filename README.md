# Kurisu
A Discord server bot started by 916253 and primarily written by ihaveamac/ihaveahax. Designed heavily around the [Nintendo Homebrew Discord](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh).

Although it is open source, this bot is not really designed to be used in other setups at the moment; the source is mainly just available for those interested in how it works on the Nintendo Homebrew server.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.7 or above
* [discord.py rewrite](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). Tested with commit [72b6b67](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/commit/d48a424f6f464044a59275d5e885b493a4a1aef7).
