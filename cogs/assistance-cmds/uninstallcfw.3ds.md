# Do you _really_ need to?
Are you trying to uninstall CFW because
- something doesn't work (eg black screen on boot, app crashes)?
- you want to reinstall or update your CFW install?
If any of these apply, you _**SHOULD NOT**_ uninstall CFW. Ask someone here, or check the [wiki page](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/3DS:Why_not_to_remove_custom_firmware) for more advice.
If you are sure you need to uninstall, [here is the guide.](https://3ds.hacks.guide/uninstall-cfw)
