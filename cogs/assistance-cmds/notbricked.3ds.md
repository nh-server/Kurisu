title: No, you are not bricked
help-desc: Missing boot.firm
---

If your power LED turns on and off after you installed b9s or your notification LED glows [any color but green](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap#led-status-codes), you are not bricked and are just missing a file called `boot.firm` in the root of your SD card.

# How to fix the issue
1. Check you inserted the SD card in your console
2. Place/replace the file, downloading it from https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases
