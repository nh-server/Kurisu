Although Nintendo says the official SD size limit is 32GB, the 3DS can accept cards up to 2TB. Ideally though, 128GB is the safe limit, as you will experience graphical issues with GBA and NDS emulation, themes and much slower load times.
In order to use them, you will have to format them to FAT32 first. Follow the intructions here to format it:
