1. On the root of your SD card, make a folder called `/badges/`, and inside it put your custom badges, as `.png` files, with a size of 64x64, or a multiple of this, in which case the badge will get split up
2. Download and install [GYTB](https://github.com/MechanicalDragon0687/GYTB/releases) (the .cia file)
3. Run the app, and all badges will be installed

## Troubleshooting:
- Is there any file with dimensions that can't be divided by 64 in the badges folder? (check for and delete preview.png)
- Do you have over 1000 badges?
