help-desc: exFAT on Switch: why not to use it
---

The recommended filesystem format for the Switch is FAT32.

While the Switch supports exFAT through an additional update from Nintendo, here are reasons not to use it:

- CFW may fail to boot due to a missing exFAT update in Horizon
- This filesystem is prone to corruption.
- Nintendo doesn't use files larger than 4GB, even with large games and exFAT.

To reformat your SD Card to FAT32, follow this [guide](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card).
